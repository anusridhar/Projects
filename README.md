# Projects
This consists of codes and details of the projects that I've developed. 
Projects: Real time face detecting using LBPH integrated with Haar Cascading classifier where I've used Artificial Neural Network to detect and track face from live video. The other project is Protein Database, which is a bioinformatics tool. This tool provides entire information about a protein when the user gives in the DNA structure. The information about protein is obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB).
